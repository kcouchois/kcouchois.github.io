# A _little_ about **ME**
## My hobbies
>* Reading
  * I love to read. I don't have a preferred genre per se. I love a good romance or thriller book, but I also love reading books about history from all over the world.
   * Some of my favorite books include:
    * _1984_ by George Orwell ![Book Cover]
     *(https://images3.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780452284234)
    * _The Great Gatsby_ F. Scott Fitzgerald

>* Gardening
  * I love to be outside in the sunshine and I have found that doing yard work and gardening is something I love - get that much needed vitamin D!
### Here are some websites I recommend if you are interested in any of my hobbies!
>- I get most of my books from [Barnes and Noble](www.barnesandnoble.com) - If you are an avid reader like me, I find that it is worth paying for their membership to get better discounts.
>- I buy most of my plants from [Lowes](lowes.com) as they have a great selection this time of year.
 - As for keeping plants them alive, I use [Google](www.google) to research as much as possible, but trust me, I have still killed many plants **lol**!
